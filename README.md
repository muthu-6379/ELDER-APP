# ELDER-APP 
ELDER APP DESCRIPTION:
The Elder Care Request Platform is a web-based application designed to support senior citizens who need assistance in their daily lives. The application provides an easy and reliable way for elderly users or their guardians to request help and connect with caregivers or volunteers. It aims to improve the quality of life of elderly people by ensuring timely support for their basic and emergency needs.

Users can register on the platform by providing essential details such as name, age, gender, contact number, email, and address. Once registered, they can submit requests for various services including medical assistance, food delivery, transportation, household support, and general care. Each request is securely stored in a database with a status and timestamp, allowing proper tracking and management.

The platform also manages caregiver and volunteer information, including availability and assigned requests, helping administrators allocate services efficiently. A service management module maintains predefined service categories, making the request process simple and organized. Additionally, a feedback system allows users to rate services and share their experience, which helps improve service quality and accountability.

The application is built using HTML and CSS for the frontend interface, PHP for backend processing, and MySQL for database management. It runs on a XAMPP localhost server and is suitable for academic projects and small-scale deployments. This project demonstrates how web technologies can be used to create meaningful social impact by enhancing elderly care, encouraging community involvement, and providing a structured solution to real-world problems.
